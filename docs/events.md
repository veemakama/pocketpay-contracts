# Vault Event Schema

This document outlines the expected event topics, payloads, and naming conventions for actions in the **Savings Vault Contract**. 

SDK maintainers can use this stable schema to consume contract events safely.

> [!NOTE]
> As events are not yet implemented in the contract, this document defines a **proposed schema**.

---

## Event Naming & Structure Conventions

All events emitted by the Savings Vault contract follow standard Soroban event guidelines:
- **Topics**: A list of topics used for filtering/routing.
  - Topic 0: The event name (e.g., Symbol representing the action).
  - Topic 1: The primary entity involved in the action (typically the `Address` of the user/admin).
- **Payload**: The data associated with the event (represented as a Soroban type or tuple).

---

## Event Definitions

### 1. Initialize Event
Emitted once when the contract is initialized by the administrator.

- **Topic 0**: `Symbol::new(&env, "initialize")`
- **Topic 1**: `admin` (`Address`) - The admin address recorded for the contract.
- **Payload**: `token` (`Address`) - The token address associated with the vault.

#### Example Payload (JSON Representation)
```json
{
  "topics": ["initialize", "GB...ADMIN_ADDRESS"],
  "value": "GB...TOKEN_ADDRESS"
}
```

---

### 2. Deposit Event
Emitted when a user deposits funds into their vault.

- **Topic 0**: `Symbol::new(&env, "deposit")`
- **Topic 1**: `user` (`Address`) - The address of the depositor.
- **Payload**: A tuple containing:
  1. `amount` (`i128`) - The amount deposited.
  2. `new_balance` (`i128`) - The user's new available balance.

#### Example Payload (JSON Representation)
```json
{
  "topics": ["deposit", "GD...USER_ADDRESS"],
  "value": [1000, 5000]
}
```

---

### 3. Withdraw Event
Emitted when a user withdraws funds from their vault.

- **Topic 0**: `Symbol::new(&env, "withdraw")`
- **Topic 1**: `user` (`Address`) - The address of the withdrawer.
- **Payload**: A tuple containing:
  1. `amount` (`i128`) - The amount withdrawn.
  2. `new_balance` (`i128`) - The user's new available balance.

#### Example Payload (JSON Representation)
```json
{
  "topics": ["withdraw", "GD...USER_ADDRESS"],
  "value": [500, 4500]
}
```

---

### 4. Lock Event
Emitted when a portion of the user's balance is locked.

- **Topic 0**: `Symbol::new(&env, "lock")`
- **Topic 1**: `user` (`Address`) - The address of the user.
- **Payload**: A tuple containing:
  1. `amount` (`i128`) - The amount locked.
  2. `unlock_time` (`u64`) - The UNIX timestamp (seconds) when the funds unlock.
  3. `new_balance` (`i128`) - The user's new available (unlocked) balance.
  4. `new_locked` (`i128`) - The user's new locked balance.

#### Example Payload (JSON Representation)
```json
{
  "topics": ["lock", "GD...USER_ADDRESS"],
  "value": [2000, 1785000000, 2500, 2000]
}
```

---

### 5. Future Token Transfer Event
Proposed event for future integration when the contract interacts directly with Stellar Asset Contract (SAC) or token transfers.

- **Topic 0**: `Symbol::new(&env, "transfer")`
- **Topic 1**: `user` (`Address`) - The address of the receiver/sender.
- **Payload**: A tuple containing:
  1. `to` (`Address`) - The recipient address.
  2. `amount` (`i128`) - The amount transferred.

#### Example Payload (JSON Representation)
```json
{
  "topics": ["transfer", "GD...SENDER_ADDRESS"],
  "value": ["GD...RECEIVER_ADDRESS", 1000]
}
```
